## How to run

Create two terminal instances. Make sure one lives in the server subfolder, and one just lives
in the main folder.

In the server subfolder terminal, run "npm i" and, then, once that is done, run "npm start"

In the main folder terminal, run "npm i" and, then, once that is done, run "npm run dev"

## Breakdown of files

src/components/ChartsPanel.tsx is the functionality behind the second page (which currently 
just displays charts but should have additional buttons as described in our wireframe)

src/routes/Results.tsx: Router wrapper for the results page. Mounts the charts app and (in your setup) reads the ?query param to auto-fill/trigger scanning. Exists to keep Splash and Charts concerns separated while enabling deep linking. 
# the results.tsx description was generated by AI, I am not sure about this one.

src/App.css is the styling for the second page (the charts page). This is the main thing that probably needs to be changed to make styling consistent for our full app.

src/App.jsx 

src/index.css is just the styling provided by default from Vite I think (vite is the template that
I am running this web app from), so probably doesn't need changing...? Feel free to ask your LLM though

src/main.tsx. Wrapper for whole app. Almost certainly doesn't need changing now.

src/Splash.css. This is the styling for the first page (the one John created), which has been copied from App.css in John's first commit.

src/Splash.tsx. This is the functionality for the first page (the one John created), which has been
mostly kept - but possibly has some slight updates for routing.

server/server.js is where the server which runs OSINT tools like sherlock runs.

## Generally describing styling:

Splash.tsx is “styled by” Splash.css (it imports that file directly).

ChartsPanel.tsx gets styles from the charts page context: global styles in App.css (or index.css), inline styles in App.jsx, and Recharts’ built-in SVG styling. So yes—effectively styled by App.css (plus its container’s inline styles).
